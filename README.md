Description of the web application:
UnIHub, like its name, is a comprehensive platform designed to bring all the tools and resources students would need in their academic career at Uni. It also serves as a hub of information, allowing for interactions with other students. It is an amalgamation of different features that University students would want. It includes a Reddit-like forum, creating study groups (along with video chatting), live note-taking with students during lectures, creating and sharing timetables with peers, and possibly a live tracking feature to see your friends' location in real-time. Our app provides an alternative for students to effectively and efficently find what they need, wihtout opening multiple different tabs. It also uses authorization, so students can be assured that they are interacting with verified students at thier University.
